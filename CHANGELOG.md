# Changelog

## 0.1.4 - 2017-10-29

The first fully correct implementation. Covered with unit tests.

## < 0.1.3

**BROKEN**

Do not use any of these versions. The package had 2 mistakes with wrong streams being used in ```spawnLineByLine``` but seemed to be working by coincidence. The example test I used was an echo program, and the combination of the mistakes was simulating an echo program.

Yes, bad luck!

These versions are **deprecated** so if you use any of them please upgrade.
